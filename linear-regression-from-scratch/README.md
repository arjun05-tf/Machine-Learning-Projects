# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using NumPy to predict
medical insurance expenses.

The focus is on understanding the mathematics behind gradient descent rather
than relying on high-level machine learning libraries.

## Key Features
- Manual implementation of gradient descent
- Mean Squared Error cost function
- Early stopping based on convergence
- Feature scaling and categorical encoding
- Cost function convergence visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
